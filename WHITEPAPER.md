# Universum (World Computer) White Paper

Revolution / Evolution - Adapt or Die - What's Next?


## 2008 - Bitcoin

Proof-of-Pudding. Yes, it worked in the beginning.
Ten years later it's a HODLer greed-fest 
waiting to collapse. Why? 
The point and value is using bitcoin for (decentralized person-to-person) 
payments, payments, payments and not for HODLing. 

Where's the consenus to make bitcoin better? 
Insane / lunatic proof-of-work mining difficulty. Centralized mining pools.
 And on and on. New currencies will take over. 
Thanks to bitcoin for showing what's possible. 
The bitcoin show is over. Old gold bugs HODLing old "fossilized" tech waiting for a get-rich / too the moon miracle. 



## 2015 - Ethereum

What's News? What's Great about Ethereum (vs "Ye Olde" Bitcoin)?

- "Turing-Complete" (Blockchain) Contract Programming Language
  - e.g. Solidity (JavaScript-Like), Vyper (Python-Like), LLL (Lisp-Like), etc.
- Contracts Own Accounts (& Budgets)
- Isolated / Protected (Blockchain) Storage for Contracts
- and more


## 2018 - Universum 

What's Wrong with Ethereum?

Not-Invented-Here, Not-Invented-Here, Not-Invented-Here Syndrome:

- Proprietary Contract Programming Language
- Proprietary Virtual Machine
- Proprietary "World State" Transition
- Proprietary "World" Database / Storage


Why not use the world's best and most popular programming languages for your contract / transaction scripts?

Universum will start with standard plain vanilla Ruby as an example on how to use a popular general-purpose programming language 
for "turing-complete" (blockchain) contract programming.   

And the "virtual machine" is the standard language runtime itself.

What about security?

The "world state" transition get serialized into standard plain-vanilla SQL statements.


Why SQL?

SQL is the 40-year-old industry standard for database "state transitions".

And for (extra) security (and scalability) 
every contract gets its own isolated / protected SQL database (storage).


To summarize:

- **NO** Proprietary Contract Programming Language => Use Any Standard Language
- **NO** Proprietary Virtual Machine  => Use Any Standard Runtime
- **NO** Proprietary "World State" Transition  => Use SQL Statements (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- **NO** Proprietary "World" (Blockchain) Database / Storage => Use SQL Databases
